# Jenny F#
My personal small F# lib for generating reports.

The project is a WIP and the direction for the project hasn't been finalised yet. The lib came about because I wanted to generate HTML/Markdown reports from a log analysis tool I was working on at work, so I decided to make a small lib to do it, which I can grow as I use it in a variety of projects.
