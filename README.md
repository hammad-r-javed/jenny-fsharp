# Jenny F# - WIP
My personal small F# lib to help with generating Markdown/HTML reports.

I'm getting familiar with F# and so The project is a WIP and the direction for the project hasn't been finalised yet. The lib came about because I wanted to generate HTML/Markdown reports from a log analysis tool I was working on at work, so I decided to make a small and simple lib to help me do it, which I can grow as I use it in a variety of projects.
